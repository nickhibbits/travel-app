# Travel App

## Overview
This mock travel app allows the user to input a destination and trip duration, then be shown a picture of the searched area as well as a logged confirmation of the dates selected for the length of their trip.

## Technical Details
This app utilizes Webpack to manage files, as well as a Node and Express environment to call 3 different APIs:

* Geonames
* Weatherbit
* Pixbay

Using chained promises on both the client and server side, the UI is updated seamlessly.

## Extra
This capstone project ties together all the skills covered in the Udacity FE nanodegree.
