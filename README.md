# Travel App

## Overview
This mock travel app is my first attempt to bring the core components of Front End Development together in a single project. 

# The app flows as follows
* First the user types a destination and trip duration. 
* Next they are given the following:
  * A picture of the area they searched.
  * A confirmation of the dates selected for the length of their trip.
  * The general weather forecaset for the timeframe of their trip.

## Technical Details
This app utilizes Webpack to manage files, as well as a Node and Express environment to call 3 different APIs:

* Geonames
* Weatherbit
* Pixbay

Using chained promises on both the client and server side, the UI is updated seamlessly. <br /><br />
Additionally the app is responsive for different window sizes

## Extra
This capstone project ties together all the skills covered in the Udacity FE nanodegree.
